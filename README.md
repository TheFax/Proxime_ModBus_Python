# Proxime ModBus communication with Python

Everything you need to communicate to a Proxime using Python.

This project started in February 2020 and ended in March 2020 due to lack of interest.
But the code wrote for the communication, the **Proxime Class** and the low level **packet generator** are working without problems and has been tested for many hours continuously.

So I decided to publish them, hoping they can be useful for other people.
